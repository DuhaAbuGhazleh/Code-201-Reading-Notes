###  1. HTML 

  - HTML elements: are usually made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.)
      
  - HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
  - Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
       **Example:**
       
    - The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.

    - The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
     </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
      
 - Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
       
 - Attributes appear on the opening tag of the element and are  made up of two parts  separated by an equals sign

    * The name  indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.

    * The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes.
