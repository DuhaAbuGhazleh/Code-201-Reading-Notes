## The Duckett HTML book:

1. Introduction (pp.2-11)
###  1. HTML 

  - HTML elements: are usually made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.)
      
  - HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
  - Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
       **Example:**
       
    - The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.

    - The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
     </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
      
 - Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
       
 - Attributes appear on the opening tag of the element and are  made up of two parts  separated by an equals sign

    * The name  indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.

    * The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes.

### 2. Extra Markup

  **-DO CTYPEs**
  
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using



  **-Comments in HT ML**
  
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->

*comments will make code much easier to understand.*
*Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser.*

**-ID Attribute**

It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).


The id attribute is known as a
global attribute because it can
be used on any element.


**-Class Attribute**

Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.

The class attribute on any
element can share the same
value.

**-Block Eleme nts**

Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
Examples of block elements are

&lt; h1 &gt;

* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
